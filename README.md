A [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) powered scrapper ðŸ”¥ that iterates trough all the internal links of the specified url.
**It works on CSR pages (React, Angular)** with dynamic urls.

Once it is done it generates a ``sitemap.xml`` file with all the urls found, ready to be uploaded to Google Search Console.

### Usage:

``` bash
$ sitemap https://vvlog.dev
```

### Params:

Parameter | type | default | description
--- | --- | --- | --- 
--wait | integer | 1500 | Specify the time to wait (So the fetches are completed) before starting to parse the page (default 1500).
--limit | integer | 999999 | Specify the limit of urls to parse before stopping the scrapper.

#### Todo:
* [x] Make it a NPM package.
* [ ] Make wait time dynamic in response of fetches inside url.
* [ ] New params that lets you specify how deep you want to go inside the url.
* [ ] Integrate it as part of build process of a create-react-app.
